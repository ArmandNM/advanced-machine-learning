### Assignment 1

Check my solution is [here](AML__Assignment_1.pdf).

**Exercise 1**. Give an example of a finite hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ with $VC \dim{}(\mathcal{H}) = 2021.$

**Exercise 2**. Give an example of a finite set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of size $4$ that is shattered by $\mathcal{H}_{balls}$ or justify why you cannot find such set.

**Exercise 3**. Show that the class $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ can be $(\epsilon, \delta)$ - PAC learned by giving an algorithm $A$ and determining an upper bound on the sample complexity $m_\mathcal{H}(\epsilon, \delta)$ such that the definition of PAC-learnability is satisfied.
